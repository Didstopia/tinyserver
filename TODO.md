# Things To Do

- [x] Scaffold a very basic HTTP server library  
- [ ] Create custom abstractions for server, route and things like requests and responses  
- [ ] Add support for easily enabling things like JSON Content-Type (custom global middleware?)  
- [x] Add support for easily adding custom routes and callbacks  
- [ ] Add support for threading/goroutines, so everything is nice and asynchronous  
- [x] Add basic unit tests  
- [ ] Add code coverage support (codecov.io)  
- [ ] Add benchmarks and test against other alternatives  
- [ ] Create a Docker image that serves as an example for a static hosting web server
